This directory is called xmls-1 locally and in my github area.

This is a fork of the latest version of Miles Egan's original xmls
repo from github, whereas xmls has been heavily modified over the years
by me.

It's my intent to move proprietary additions out of my xmls library,
then unify xmls and xmls-1, then rename xmls-1 to xmls on my github
and make it a public repo.

I'll submit a pull request to Egan if I've made any worthwhile improvements.
